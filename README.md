# Hangman

# this game is just as you play it in real life.

The computer thinks of a word and you guess a letter and then the computer tells you if this letter in the word or not.

You have 8 guesses, if you guessed the letter right the guesses won't decrease, 'it decreases only if you guesses a letter wrong'
If you guessed the word right so, Congrats you won.

Enjoy playing this game and if you want to develop the code or play with it whatever you want, just do it.

Happy Coding ;)
