# Hangman

# this game is just as you play it in real life.

The computer thinking of a word and you guessing a letter and then the computer tells you if this letter in the word or not.

You have 8 guesses, if you guessed it right the guesses won't decease, 'it decreases only if you guesses a letter wrong'
If you guessed the word right so, Congrats you won.

Engoy playing this game and if you want develop the code or do with it whatever you want.
Happy Coding ;)
